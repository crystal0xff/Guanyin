[Style Prompt: Create a sophisticated and deeply emotional Cantopop ballad in Joey Yung's signature style, showcasing exceptional vocal prowess and smooth melodic sensibilities. The song should feature powerful, emotive female vocals with a wide dynamic range and profound emotional depth. Instrumentation is led by piano and a lush string orchestra, with a tasteful pop rhythm section providing foundation. The song's harmonic language should evolve: begin with melancholic minor and suspended chords (e.g., Am, Dm7, Gsus4) reflecting pain, gradually incorporating more major, Maj7, and add9 chords in later sections to suggest a journey towards healing and bittersweet acceptance. Production must be clean, modern, and spacious, highlighting the masterful vocal performance as it navigates complex emotions. The focus is on a heartfelt vocal journey supported by evocative harmony.]

[Title: 百子櫃]

[Verse 1]
(Music begins with sparse, melancholic piano chords – e.g., Am7, Dm7, Gsus4 resolving to G. Joey's voice enters softly, conveying restrained bitterness and sorrow. Strings enter with sustained, somber pads – Cmaj7, Fmaj7, adding warmth yet retaining melancholy.)
當愛像「蓮子心」苦澀入喉
卻似「當歸」不願停留
心裡深處堆滿過去溫柔
每一格沾滿記憶塵垢

(Piano voicings perhaps add a minor 9th for poignancy. Voice with growing intensity.)
當回憶寫著白竹的愁
誓言是帶了鐵秀的針究
守著藥櫃 苦苦等候

[Pre-Chorus]
(Harmonic tension increases slightly – e.g., using diminished passing chords or a pedal point under shifting minor chords. Vocals express brewing pain.)
人心的火在燒
黃連的苦水仍在煎熬
裂開的傷口一道又一道
醫不好你留下的病灶

[Chorus 1]
(Fuller instrumentation. Chord progression becomes more defined and powerful, still rooted in minor or modal harmony – e.g., Am - G/B - C - F. Strings soar. Vocals are emotive, showcasing range.)
為什麼相思要配一碗「川弓」
癡心人苦澀的心被挖空
在百子櫃之中 每一格是裂縫
我像離開身體的「鹿容」

為什麼心死要服用斷腸紅
癡情人沉醉的情太沉重
在百子櫃之中 每一格是冷宮
文武火也煮不暖這種凍

[Verse 2]
(Music softens, returning to a more intimate piano and string texture. Chords reflect quiet desperation – e.g., Em7, A7sus4-A7, Dm. Vocals are narrative, tinged with sadness.)
當愛如「熟地」讓心底黑透
卻像「八角」不願放手
藥碗浸透寫滿虛構永久
每一滴藥湯不再擁有

當時間都釀出「服零」的酒
承諾是利刃狠狠地解剖
守著藥櫃 不甘放手

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Similar harmonic build and emotional intensity as Pre-Chorus 1.)
滾燙的益母草
破碎愛情如去核紅棗
喝過的苦藥一包又一包
醫不好你離去的感冒

[Chorus 2]
(Chorus returns with sustained emotional power. Chord voicings might be richer, strings more active.)
為什麼相思要配一碗「川弓」
癡心人苦澀的心被挖空
在百子櫃之中 每一格是裂縫
我像離開身體的「鹿容」

為什麼心死要服用斷腸紅
癡情人沉醉的情太沉重
在百子櫃之中 每一格是冷宮
文武火也煮不暖這種凍

[Bridge]
(Music becomes introspective. Piano plays thoughtful, perhaps slightly dissonant chords resolving to softer ones – e.g., F#m7(b5) - B7(b9) - Em. Cello offers a poignant counter-melody. Vocals are reflective, building towards the Hook.)
藥渣怎熬出新的溫柔
愛意褪去 早應放手
起死回生可會更加難受

[Hook]
(Harmonic shift towards more open or suspended sounds resolving upwards – e.g., Gsus4 - G - Cadd9. Music swells with strings. Vocals deliver with stark clarity and burgeoning strength.)
藥效才剛抵禦寒冬
細數百子櫃 遺留千百種痛
已看不清 過往種種

[Final Chorus]
(Music reaches its most cathartic point. Key might subtly lift or harmonies brighten with more Major chords and extensions – Cmaj7, Fmaj7, G add9. Orchestra is full. Vocals are at their peak, expressing a bittersweet acceptance and emerging strength – a "healing" quality.)
為什麼回憶會比「砒霜」更濃
苦情人的眼淚早已流空
在百子櫃之中 每一格是牢籠
困著那思念在洶湧躁動

為什麼光陰會讓心痛更痛
我仍在貪戀那虛構美夢
在百子櫃之中 每一格在失控
(Vocals hold a powerful, sustained note, then soften with a sense of hopeful release.)
無法接受 愛不在 櫃中

[Outro]
(Music resolves peacefully. Piano plays gentle, arpeggiated major or Lydian chords – e.g., Cmaj7#11, Fmaj7. Strings hold warm, sustained notes. Vocals are soft, conveying a fragile but determined peace. The "healing" element is prominent here.)
煎好的藥 若你陪我入喉
這腐朽也許醫得好
(A final, hopeful piano chord – C add9 or Gmaj7 – fades slowly with strings.)
卻是你陪我入土
