[Verse 1]
(Music starts very slow, piano with jazzy chords, minimalist)
(Vocals soft, almost spoken, intimate)
付出嘅再多 未及你背叛折磨
用甜言蜜語堆砌虛假承諾
偽誓言的火 焚燒我當初太傻
(Slight pause, breathy)
天荒地老謊話被識穿 對或錯

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Subtle bassline might enter, piano melody becomes slightly more defined)
餘情仍殘缺 總會有錯覺
也嘗試沉默中僭越
燃盡嘅玫瑰已褪去絕色
(Voice with a hint of confusion)
夢裡面又會是誰呢

[Chorus 1]
(Soft, slow Acid Jazz groove begins – very subtle drums, smooth bass. Piano remains prominent. Vocals emotive but still soft)
愛化做灰燼 冰冷嘅心 似無窮無盡
是不言而喻早已註定嘅宿命
(Slightly more rhythmic phrasing in vocals)
愛恨變陣營 都想要對方嘅命

舊夢在轟鳴 餘燼在飄零 燃盡的結晶
倒映著當天你身影
被燒紅的心 還是決意化作夜空嘅流星 (Gentle vocal run on "流星")

[Verse 2]
(Groove continues subtly, piano takes slight melodic lead)
偽誓言的火 吞噬全部承諾
海誓山盟情話變漩渦 看輪廓

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Atmosphere becomes slightly cooler, perhaps with wintry pads)
斷章跟殘頁 會有些膽怯
會陷入無盡嘅黑夜
凋零嘅薔薇已脫去鮮豔
(Voice trails off sadly)
夢裡面又再次擱淺

[Chorus 2]
(Consistent with Chorus 1, maintaining the soft, sad Acid Jazz feel)
愛化做灰燼 冰冷嘅心 似無窮無盡
是不言而喻早已註定嘅宿命
愛恨變陣營 都想要對方嘅命

舊夢在轟鳴 餘燼在飄零 燃盡的結晶
倒映著當天你身影
被燒紅的心 還是決意化作夜空嘅流星

[Bridge]
(Music becomes even sparser, piano very reflective, bassline minimal or drops out. Vocals very intimate and breathy)
火舌上徘徊 尋覓已失去的愛
火勢蔓延到腦海 靜待年月掩埋

[Pre-Chorus 3]
(A sense of fragile hope or change, subtle shift in harmony, soft build)
燃盡嘅灰 隨風亂飛
隨時間流逝而成廢墟
凋零嘅薔薇再伴隨玫瑰
(Voice gains a touch of ethereal quality)
夢裡面再長出花蕾

[Final Chorus]
(Music perhaps a little warmer here, but still slow and soft. Vocals express a bittersweet resolution)
愛已成灰燼 冰冷嘅心 似如夢初醒
是掙脫枷鎖一種覺醒
愛恨變幻影 消磨掉彼此光景

舊夢現已停 餘溫漸散盡 重生的心靈
背負起新的使命
被燒過的心 最終也化作夜空嘅繁星 (Vocals with a gentle, hopeful lift)

[Outro]
(Music fades slowly, piano plays a final melancholic jazzy progression)
被燒過的心 最終也化作夜空嘅繁星
(Music fades to silence)
