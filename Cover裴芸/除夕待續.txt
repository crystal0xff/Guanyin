[Verse 1]
(Voice soft, melancholic)
心愛嘅你 感情已被拋棄
臨近除夕 約定通通作廢
幸福嘅 已被人代替
美好回憶 殘留滿眼憔悴
嗰一晚 星光之下 賞煙花艷麗

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Slightly more movement, subtle harmonies might start)
內心的哭牆
當初誓言猶在響
盡情哭吧 回味上個除夕時光
開口放聲將愛講
閉上眼擁吻 帶著慨歎
(Voice becomes more wistful)
妄想會 信誓旦旦 如願成雙

[Chorus 1]
(Beat might enter softly here, piano chords become fuller)
年末嘅鐘聲忽然響起
遺失嘅愛 仍彌留在天際
煙花燃起 實在無法躲避
全城人倒數 愛剩低幾秒計

[Chorus 2]
(Continues smoothly from Chorus 1, maybe more prominent harmony)
我仍心灰意冷地尋覓
煙花無法照亮愛決堤
你我之間 所有嘅記憶
全停留上個除夕
[Vocalization]
(Soft, emotive ad-lib like 'Hmm...' or 'Ooh...')

[Verse 2]
(Beat might simplify again, focus on piano and voice)
除夕月光 將影子拉長
煙花璀璨 炮仗聲響迴盪
失去嘅 早註定流浪
過去嘅 也許應埋葬
(Voice perhaps slightly more resigned)
今夜我 喺歡聲笑語間獨自悲傷

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Building slightly again, reflecting the internal struggle)
內心的斷橋
舊日誓言仍縈繞
盡情笑吧 回望去年除夕浪潮
諷刺當初一切美妙
抵抗背叛那煎熬
忍受冷漠嘅嘲笑
(Voice holds a touch of lingering hope & pain)
曾期盼 會共你天造地設 到老

[Chorus 1 Repeat]
(Beat and harmonies return, familiar melancholic feeling)
年末嘅鐘聲忽然響起
遺失嘅愛 仍彌留在天際
煙花燃起 實在無法躲避
全城人倒數 愛剩低幾秒計

[Chorus 2 Repeat]
(Fuller R&B feel, smooth harmonies)
我仍心灰意冷地尋覓
煙花無法照亮愛決堤
你我之間 所有嘅記憶
全停留上個除夕

[Bridge]
(Music might become sparser, more intimate, piano focus, voice very soft and close)
一句再見 之後再冇下文
悲與喜 混集纏繞到凌晨
迎合佳節 眼淚還是強忍
(Voice almost breaks, breathy)
煙花餘燼 點點似我淚痕

[Chorus 3 - Variation]
(Slightly different melodic feel perhaps, reflecting the shift to Lunar New Year, still sad)
農曆嘅鐘聲終於響起
失去嘅愛 到底跌落咗哪裏
煙花流走 回復一片沉寂
(Voice filled with sad realization)
怎料到 愛戀都有盡頭嘅除夕

[Chorus 4 - Outro Variation]
(Music starts to fade gently, more atmospheric, piano prominent)
(Voice soft, resigned, looking forward with melancholy)
我將孤身撐過這哀愁嘅春季
佳節氣氛 掩蓋不到愛決堤
新春開始 願望偏偏全不是
寄望在 下一個除夕

[Outro]
(Piano melody plays out, voice whispers final line)
寄望下一個除夕
(Music fades completely)
