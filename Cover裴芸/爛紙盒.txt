[Style Prompt: A slow, soft, melancholic Cantopop/R&B ballad led by piano, featuring intimate female vocals. Atmosphere is deeply sad, lovelorn, reflecting the 'Rotten Paper Box' metaphor of feeling discarded and fragile. Subtly incorporate an unsettling feeling suggestive of emotional fragility or dissociation (mirroring 'neurological disorder' prompt hint) through atmospheric sound design - perhaps occasional dissonant pads, rhythmic hesitations, sparse soft glitches, or a particularly vulnerable, almost detached vocal delivery, while maintaining the overall soft, slow, emotive core.]

[Verse 1]
(Music starts minimalist, piano, perhaps slightly hesitant)
(Voice soft, fragile)
可能空殼太簡陋
未滿足到你嘅渴求
一經拆開了之後
碎裂散落喺門口

[Pre-Chorus]
(Slight build, maybe unsettling synth pad enters low)
我奢求 某天你會念記這雙手
也想過 溫柔話語早已溜走
(Voice slightly strained)
欺騙我未曾傷透
謊言藉口 點樣回收

[Chorus]
(Beat enters softly, piano chords fuller, main melody established)
(Voice gains a little strength but remains sad)
唔會 唔會有傷透嘅愛 回到舊箱
你個心早已堆滿新的冀望
似過期贈品標上咗售價
荒謬絕倫嗰種虛妄
(Slightly more intensity, perhaps subtle dissonance in harmony)
寧願淒風苦雨廢棄舊墳場
好過暗中窺看 你新嘅包裝
想逃避嘅痛楚悽慘景況
燒光去 更覺釋放 (Voice trails off slightly)

[Verse 2]
(Music perhaps returns to sparser arrangement)
也許裂痕已太舊
曾狠心摧毀過結構
掀開咗嗰個缺口
(Voice becomes breathy, intimate)
卻滲漏出舊溫柔

[Pre-Chorus]
(Building tension again, maybe rhythmic unease)
我守候 過去你應承過說永久
我強笑 話這破紙盒應該回收
堆積喺愛戀門口
(Voice with a touch of bitterness)
對錯好醜 一腳踢走

[Chorus Repeat]
(Fuller sound again, emotive delivery)
唔會 唔會有傷透嘅愛 回到舊箱
你個心早已堆滿新的冀望
似過期贈品標上咗售價
荒謬絕倫嗰種虛妄
寧願淒風苦雨廢棄舊墳場
好過暗中窺看 你新嘅包裝
想逃避嘅痛楚悽慘景況
燒光去 更覺釋放

[Bridge]
(Music becomes very sparse, atmospheric, maybe just piano and pads with slight dissonance. Voice is vulnerable, close mic'd)
紙摺嘅心 經不起火舌太無情
舊日片段太辛酸 烙印心境
連同埋愛情
(Voice almost a whisper)
燒作灰燼 看未明

[Final Chorus]
(Music might build differently here, perhaps more resigned or hollow feeling, less of a traditional climax)
唔會有撕開嘅愛 回到舊箱
我個心早已沾滿冰冷風霜
燃燒殆盡再沒有憾
極疼痛這趟翱翔
(Sense of strange peace or release)
爛紙盒化身一道新的曙光
照亮被流放廢棄舊墳場
靈魂喺廢墟潰散
(Whispered afterthought, slightly detached)
(寄望來生再看)

[Outro]
(Music fades slowly, repeating Bridge motif perhaps. Voice repeats lines softly, like fading thoughts)
摺過嘅爛紙盒 磨蝕了棱角
換不到 你一再回望
(Repeating Bridge lines softly, with more distance)
紙摺嘅心 經不起火舌太無情
舊日片段太辛酸 烙印心境
連同埋愛情
燒作灰燼 看未明
(Music fades completely)
