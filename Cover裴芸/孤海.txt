Integrate sea wave sounds naturally into the rhythm and texture of the music, creating a sense of vastness, ebb and flow, and tranquil solitude.

Clean, polished production with a focus on emotional depth.]

[Verse 1]
(Music starts very slow, soft piano with watery reverb, distant sea wave sounds begin to establish atmosphere)
(Vocals soft, almost a whisper, melancholic)
夜風孤單巨浪吻海灘
此刻世間
靜似深海一般裴伴

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Subtle R&B beat might enter very gently, piano chords become a bit fuller)
無邊大海 愛戀卻無奈
彼此緘默
(Voice with a sigh)
留下失敗嘅感慨

[Chorus 1]
(Music swells slightly, sea wave sounds might become more prominent, layered with pads. Vocals emotive but still soft)
海 遼闊到 觸摸不到邊界
海 深邃到 如山崩跟破裂
直到你我惜別
才清楚看見 已停歇

往昔沉落海底
悲傷無蹤無跡
再也看不見日出
漩渦中狠狠捲走了憶記

月下泛起海中倒影
愛情嘅故事按下了暫停
海浪拍岸製造幻聽
海裡邊倒映天上繁星
(Voice trails off, wistful)
我厭倦過份清醒

[Verse 2]
(Music softens again, focus on piano, voice, and gentle wave sounds)
潮汐聲迴盪 心逐浪飄遠
回憶畫面
(Voice slightly hazy, dream-like)
模糊似夢境般散亂

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Beat might become a little more defined but still very slow)
潮水漲又落 帶走了寄託
剩低我一個
描畫悲傷輪廓

[Chorus 1a Repeat]
(Music similar to the first part of Chorus 1, emphasizing the vastness)
海 遼闊到 觸摸不到邊界
海 深邃到 如山崩跟破裂
直到你我惜別
才清楚看見 已停歇

[Chorus 2]
(Music takes on a slightly different melancholic shade, perhaps different chord voicings or pad textures. Sea sounds continue)
回憶如細沙吹去
猶如聽哀悼嘅樂曲
不再尋覓遠去日期
海底中漸漸旋轉再漂移

風中傳來遙遠歎息
往日誓言早已變瞬息
黑暗之中尋找躲避
海中深埋藏心意
(Voice with deep longing)
我渴望就此沉溺

[Bridge]
(Music becomes very atmospheric, perhaps piano only with prominent sea wave sounds and shimmering pads. Vocals are intimate, hopeful yet fragile)
在深海點亮一盞孤燈星火
照亮心底未曾講嘅承諾
(Gentle vocal run)
穿越浪濤 尋覓愛嘅輪廓

[Chorus 3]
(Music becomes a bit brighter, more hopeful, though still slow and gentle. Piano melody more uplifting. Wave sounds perhaps calmer, like lapping waves)
遠方燈塔亮起
照亮愛戀軌跡
跟隨星宿指引
浪花中輕輕寄託這情意

[Outro]
(Music fades slowly, piano plays a gentle, hopeful melody. Sea wave sounds become very soft. Vocals repeat the hopeful wish, almost a whisper)
星空下誠心許個願
你我嘅故事會重新燃點
海浪似撥動愛戀琴弦
天空繁星終於重現
(Whispered, fading)
我期待這天
(Sea wave sounds and piano fade to silence)
